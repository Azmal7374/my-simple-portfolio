    "title": "Geometric Calculation",
    "description": "Geometric calculations are mathematical computations that involve properties and relationships of various shapes and figures. These calculations are fundamental to fields such as engineering, architecture, physics, and computer graphics. Here are some common geometric calculations. Area: The area is the measure of the space enclosed by a two-dimensional shape. For example, the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.Perimeter: The perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a two-dimensional shape. It is calculated by adding the lengths of all the sides. For instance, the perimeter of a square is found by multiplying its side length by 4.Volume: Volume is the measure of the space occupied by a three-dimensional shape. It is calculated differently depending on the shape. For example, the volume of a cube is found by cubing its side length.Circumference: The circumference is the distance around the outer boundary of a circle. It is calculated by multiplying the diameter (or radius) by π (pi).Pythagorean Theorem: This theorem relates the sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.Similarity: Geometric similarity refers to two shapes that have the same shape but possibly different sizes. The ratio of corresponding lengths of the similar shapes remains constant.Trigonometry: Trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent are used to calculate angles and side lengths in triangles.",
